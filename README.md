# WCS Holiday Card 🎄❄️

Welcome to the WCS Holiday Card project! This repository contains templates for creating festive, interactive holiday cards and snow globes for our club event.

## About This Event

This is a fun, creative coding event where you'll learn to build interactive web projects with a holiday theme. No prior experience required – just bring your creativity and holiday spirit!

You'll have two template options to choose from:
- **Interactive Holiday Card** - Create a personalized, animated greeting card
- **Snow Globe** - Build a customizable snow globe with interactive elements

## What's in This Repository?

This repository contains starter templates with pre-written HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that you can customize. Think of it as a creative starting point – you'll modify colors, text, animations, and more to make it your own!

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Use This Template

Using this repository as a template creates a brand new repository in your account with all the starter code.

1. Click the green **Use this template** button at the top of this page
2. Select **Create a new repository**
3. Give your repository a name (like `my-holiday-card` or `holiday-project-2024`)
4. Choose whether to make it Public or Private
5. Click **Create repository**
6. GitHub will create your new repository with all the template files!

### Step 2: Choose Your Template

Navigate to the template you want to work with:
- `interactive-card/` - For the holiday card template
- `snow-globe/` - For the snow globe template

### Step 3: Edit Your Files

You can edit files directly on GitHub:

1. Click on the file you want to edit (usually `index.html` to start)
2. Click the pencil icon (✏️) in the top-right corner
3. Make your changes in the editor
4. Scroll down and click **Commit changes**
5. Add a brief description of what you changed (optional but helpful!)
6. Click **Commit changes** again to save

**What can you customize?**
- Text and messages
- Colors and backgrounds
- Animation speeds
- Images (you can use URLs from image hosting sites)
- Interactive elements

### Step 4: Preview Your Changes

After committing changes, you can view your project live on the web (see "Hosting Your Project" below).

## Hosting Your Project with GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages lets you host your project for free so anyone can view it online!

### Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings** (near the top of the page)
3. Scroll down to the **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **main** (or **master**) branch
5. Select the folder:
   - Choose **/ (root)** if your template is in the main folder
   - Or select **/docs** if instructed
6. Click **Save**

### Find Your Live Site

After a few minutes, your site will be live! The URL will be:
```
https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name/
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `your-repository-name` with whatever you named your repository.

To view a specific template:
- Holiday Card: `https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name/interactive-card/`
- Snow Globe: `https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name/snow-globe/`

**Note:** It may take 5-10 minutes for your site to go live after enabling GitHub Pages or making updates.
